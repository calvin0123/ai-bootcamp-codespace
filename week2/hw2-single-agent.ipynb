They are gregarious animals, commonly living in groups that can number over 100 during the dry season. Their diet consists mainly of grasses and aquatic plants, and they practice coprophagy, eating their feces to maximize nutrient absorption. Although not currently threatened, they face hunting pressures in some regions, and capybara meat is considered a delicacy in Venezuela, particularly during Lent.',\n",
