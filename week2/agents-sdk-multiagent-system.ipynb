       "2:07 your career journey so far.\n",
       "2:09 >> Yes. So yeah I did my bachelor's here in\n",
       "2:13 Ecuador. So I studied biotechnology\n",
       "2:16 engineering which basically is the\n",
       "2:19 application of living organisms to\n",
       "2:22 different\n",
       "2:24 in different areas. So you can apply it\n",
       "2:26 to kind of develop new potential drugs\n",
       "2:30 or to kind of in agriculture\n",
       "2:34 and all of the applications are based on\n",
       "2:37 living organisms. it can be in in\n",
       "2:40 different parts and\n",
       "2:43 then while I was doing my bachelors I\n",
       "2:47 realized that I didn't like that much\n",
       "2:49 that and the wet lab and biology and\n",
       "2:52 this stuff so I started to take some\n",
       "2:55 electives on programming and maths and I\n",
       "2:59 kind of I like that more that approach\n",
       "3:02 so I kind of did a minor in software\n",
       "3:04 engineering\n",
       "3:06 yeah and then in my masters I combine\n",
       "3:08 both in binformatics and during the last\n",
       "3:10 year I've been working more on software\n",
       "3:12 development for the bionirmatics.\n",
       "3:17 >> And you said you just finished your\n",
       "3:19 project which was in Denmark and you\n",
       "3:20 moved to Ecuador to spend the winter\n",
       "3:22 there. Amazing idea. Yeah. So I live in\n",
       "3:25 Berlin. So I can imagine what it is like\n",
       "3:29 now in Denmark. Uh so I think it's even\n",
       "3:33 worse than in Berlin cuz it's like by\n",
       "3:34 the sea, closer to the sea. So yeah,\n",
       "3:37 good idea spending time in Ecuador. Um\n",
       "3:39 but um what exactly was your project\n",
       "3:41 about? I don't know to what extent you\n",
       "3:43 can talk about this, but was it pure\n",
       "3:45 software engineering? Was it\n",
       "3:46 bioinformatics? What do you actually do\n",
       "3:49 now?\n",
       "3:50 >> Yeah. Uh during the the last projects\n",
       "3:53 that I worked during the la basically is\n",
       "3:56 like I first I did my masters in the\n",
       "3:59 Netherlands. I forgot to mention that in\n",
       "4:01 bionopromatics and I did my master\n",
       "4:03 thesis abroad like with my supervisor in\n",
       "4:06 Denmark at\n",
       "4:09 the technical university of Denmark and\n",
       "4:14 during my master thesis I work in a\n",
       "4:17 project that we call MCW2 graph. So\n",
       "4:20 basically this is a knowledge graph to\n",
       "4:22 investigate the wastewater treatment\n",
       "4:24 microbiome. So basically a microbiome is\n",
       "4:28 kind of the kind of all of the\n",
       "4:31 microorganisms that live in a specific\n",
       "4:33 environment. So what we did is like\n",
       "4:37 usually like people take samples from\n",
       "4:40 different environments in this case\n",
       "4:43 wastewater treatment plants and then\n",
       "4:46 they take samples and then they sequence\n",
       "4:48 all of the kind the DNA or the proteins\n",
       "4:51 that are inside this environment. And\n",
       "4:53 then when you kind of process this data\n",
       "4:56 you can see like the presence of\n",
       "4:59 different the presence and abundance of\n",
       "5:01 microorganisms in these samples. So what\n",
       "5:04 we did is that we took kind of studies\n",
       "5:07 from different kind of regions around\n",
       "5:11 the world, different wastewater\n",
       "5:12 treatments all over the world and then\n",
       "5:14 we combine this data and then we imper\n",
       "5:17 kind of these microbial association\n",
       "5:19 networks we call. So it's like\n",
       "5:22 correlation networks based on abundance\n",
       "5:25 patterns. So based on co-abundance let's\n",
       "5:28 say that we find a microorganism in this\n",
       "5:31 sample and the same like another\n",
       "5:34 microorganisms is also present in this\n",
       "5:36 sample with a similar abundance. So we\n",
       "5:39 kind of we infer that they are kind of\n",
       "5:43 interacting somehow. So we created this\n",
       "5:47 kind of networks and then we build a\n",
       "5:49 knowledge gra on top of that with\n",
       "5:51 additional metadata.\n",
       "5:53 Yeah, that was my first project there\n",
       "5:56 and then I work on others.\n",
       "5:59 >> Yeah, I'm taking notes so I can ask you\n",
       "6:02 later about these things. But uh for me\n",
       "6:04 I know nothing about biotechnology.\n",
       "6:07 >> Mhm. Um so when COVID happened right and\n",
       "6:12 everyone was uh freaking out and then\n",
       "6:14 people companies started to develop\n",
       "6:16 vaccines. So do people like is\n",
       "6:20 biotechnology involved there for\n",
       "6:24 >> like how exactly does it work? Yeah,\n",
       "6:27 actually it's like um so because you do\n",
       "6:31 the experiments on on the lab to test\n",
       "6:35 like the different\n",
       "6:37 vaccines and how different compounds\n",
       "6:40 kind of\n",
       "6:42 can kill or combat the bacteria or the\n",
       "6:45 viruses and you do that in the in the\n",
       "6:50 lab. and and that is kind of\n",
       "6:52 biotechnology and you design different\n",
       "6:54 like components that are more efficient\n",
       "6:56 to combat the viruses and and bacteria\n",
       "6:58 and then bionirmatics\n",
       "7:01 enters\n",
       "7:03 here like to kind of reduce the amount\n",
       "7:06 of experiments that you need to do on\n",
       "7:08 the web lab. So you can do some\n",
       "7:10 simulations or you can analyze the the\n",
       "7:13 data to kind of propose potential\n",
       "7:15 candidates that the people on the web\n",
       "7:18 can test. So you reduce the time and you\n",
       "7:22 propose some potential candidates that\n",
       "7:24 in the end like the wet lab people test.\n",
       "7:28 >> Yeah. I see. I think you have a slight\n",
       "7:30 problem with um sound. Uh are you do you\n",
       "7:34 use your uh headphones microphone?\n",
       "7:38 >> Yeah. Uh I can\n",
       "7:39 >> you can switch to\n",
       "7:43 Can you try now?\n",
       "7:46 I cannot hear you.\n",
       "7:50 I'm sorry everyone. Um, but yeah, just\n",
       "7:52 the sound is breaking a little.\n",
       "7:58 Sorry. Now I switch to the my\n",
       "8:03 laptop. Uh,\n",
       "8:04 >> I think it's better. Yeah, cuz like the\n",
       "8:06 the the sound was breaking a little like\n",
       "8:09 every 3 seconds. That's why I thought\n",
       "8:11 maybe it's like Bluetooth artifact.\n",
       "8:14 >> Okay. Yeah, let's try. I think it's\n",
       "8:16 better. So you were saying that um this\n",
       "8:20 is what biotechnology\n",
       "8:23 uh people who work in biotechnology this\n",
       "8:25 is what they do especially when it comes\n",
       "8:26 to like um these viruses and bacteria.\n",
       "8:29 So you have a lab and in the lab uh you\n",
       "8:33 have these experiments in the lab. So\n",
       "8:35 you have bacteria or viruses and then\n",
       "8:39 you make different experiments to see\n",
       "8:41 what actually kills what helps to combat\n",
       "8:44 these things. Right? So that's\n",
       "8:45 >> that's what what biotechnologists do,\n",
       "8:47 right? So they work in companies like\n",
       "8:50 Fizer or other pharmaceutical companies,\n",
       "8:53 right? And then they make these\n",
       "8:55 experiments.\n",
       "8:56 >> Mhm. Yes.\n",
       "8:57 >> Yeah. Why is it called vet lab? Like is\n",
       "9:00 it wet there in the lab?\n",
       "9:02 >> Yeah. because it's kind of to make this\n",
       "9:04 distinction between\n",
       "9:06 dry lab which is more computational and\n",
       "9:09 you don't kind of get your hands kind of\n",
       "9:12 wet in a way and then yeah the other way\n",
       "9:15 you need to do the actual experiments.\n",
       "9:17 So yeah you have this distinction with\n",
       "9:19 wet lab and dry lab. M so dry lab is you\n",
       "9:24 sit in front of a computer but lab you\n",
       "9:26 actually do all you know how all this um\n",
       "9:30 like if you ask um to generate an image\n",
       "9:33 of a person trying to develop a vaccine\n",
       "9:35 I imagine they are like you know in\n",
       "9:37 white clothes with glasses like holding\n",
       "9:41 this uh you know how they call like\n",
       "9:43 small bottles\n",
       "9:44 >> tubes exactly like doing these things\n",
       "9:47 and then there are like charts behind\n",
       "9:49 their backs\n",
       "9:51 Yeah.\n",
       "9:53 >> Okay. You didn't enjoy this part, right?\n",
       "9:55 Working in the lab.\n",
       "9:57 >> Yes. No. No. Yeah. It's like um Yeah. I\n",
       "10:00 didn't like it that much and and also in\n",
       "10:03 my bachelor's kind of this this\n",
       "10:04 biological courses I didn't like that\n",
       "10:06 much the approach. It was much kind of\n",
       "10:09 too theoretical and they have this kind\n",
       "10:12 of learning by heart approach. So yeah\n",
       "10:16 like um yeah in the middle of of my\n",
       "10:19 bachelors I was like I don't like this\n",
       "10:20 that much let's try that something else\n",
       "10:23 and yeah I took like some programming\n",
       "10:26 and math courses and yeah I realized\n",
       "10:28 that the approach is a bit different\n",
       "10:30 there is more practical so yeah I\n",
       "10:32 remember that in the first programming\n",
       "10:34 course that I took is like the first\n",
       "10:36 maybe the f just the first course the\n",
       "10:39 first class was theoretical and the rest\n",
       "10:41 was just doing exercises just hands-on\n",
       "10:43 on on the computer. So, I don't know. I\n",
       "10:46 like it that a bit more.\n",
       "10:48 >> Okay. Okay. And uh in the Netherlands,\n",
       "10:51 where do you study? In which university?\n",
       "10:53 >> In Mastri. Mastrict University.\n",
       "10:56 >> Mastrict.\n",
       "10:58 >> I don't know about this one. I\n",
       "10:59 >> actually is in the borderline with\n",
       "11:01 Belgium and Germany. Yeah. Just next to\n",
       "11:04 Aken.\n",
       "11:06 >> Okay. Okay.\n",
       "11:07 >> Mhm.\n",
       "11:08 >> Yeah. I I didn't know this thing existed\n",
       "11:11 but so you worked uh you studied there\n",
       "11:14 and then as a part of um your studies\n",
       "11:17 you went to Denmark to work on projects\n",
       "11:21 >> yes yes\n",
       "11:22 >> okay okay and what is so we talked about\n",
       "11:25 biotechnology biotechnology engineering\n",
       "11:28 so this is uh I guess it's just only one\n",
       "11:31 application but these are the people who\n",
       "11:33 develop drugs these are the people who\n",
       "11:34 develop vaccines right so that's\n",
       "11:36 biotechnology\n",
       "11:38 What is bioinformatics like how is it\n",
       "11:40 different?\n",
       "11:42 >> Yes, bioinformatics um yeah I would say\n",
       "11:45 that I can I usually like define it as\n",
       "11:49 data science applied to biology. So it's\n",
       "11:52 like yeah just the domain of application\n",
       "11:55 of data science is biology. So we just\n",
       "11:59 um take the information that is\n",
       "12:01 generated in the lab and then we do all\n",
       "12:05 of the kind of typical data science\n",
       "12:08 process like the data exploration,\n",
       "12:10 exploratory analysis and then\n",
       "12:13 interpretation of the results and then\n",
       "12:15 we create some models to kind of predict\n",
       "12:17 some stuff. So yeah I would define it\n",
       "12:20 like that.\n",
       "12:21 So basically you\n",
       "12:24 do data science too but the\n",
       "12:26 biotechnology is an old field and data\n",
       "12:27 science is like I don't know 15 years\n",
       "12:30 old.\n",
       "12:30 >> Yeah that's true.\n",
       "12:32 >> Okay. So um but what kind of data you\n",
       "12:35 have? I remember so I mentioned at the\n",
       "12:37 beginning that at some point of time I\n",
       "12:40 took a course about bioinformatics. I\n",
       "12:44 think we used R back then\n",
       "12:46 >> and um I don't remember much except like\n",
       "12:49 all the data we the data we were working\n",
       "12:51 in they consisted of four different\n",
       "12:53 letters.\n",
       "12:54 >> Mhm.\n",
       "12:54 >> Right.\n",
       "12:55 >> Yes.\n",
       "12:56 >> Um so what are these letters? Uh exactly\n",
       "12:59 >> these are the basically the nucleotides.\n",
       "13:01 So basically you can have\n",
       "13:04 >> the nucleotides is like the the if you\n",
       "13:08 have kind of genomics data is DNA. So\n",
       "13:10 the DNA is composed of different kind of\n",
       "13:14 chemical compounds that we call\n",
       "13:16 nucleotides. These are like four\n",
       "13:19 adinine, wenosine, cytosine and\n",
       "13:24 yeah the other one but yeah just these\n",
       "13:27 four letters that kind of are inside the\n",
       "13:30 nucle nucleus or olive cells and they\n",
       "13:34 kind of contain the genetic information\n",
       "13:37 that kind of make all the proteins that\n",
       "13:40 kind of yeah deliver all the functions\n",
       "13:44 in our systems. Mhm. Okay. So, um yeah,\n",
       "13:49 to me like still I'm very far from\n",
       "13:51 there, but I remember that it was like\n",
       "13:53 mostly strings of text with these four\n",
       "13:56 letters.\n",
       "13:57 >> Um so, you mentioned that in one of the\n",
       "14:01 projects that you did or was one of the\n",
       "14:03 last or maybe one of the projects you\n",
       "14:05 did, you needed to sequence DNA and\n",
       "14:07 proteins.\n",
       "14:08 >> Mhm.\n",
       "14:09 >> I have no idea what it means. Like, what\n",
       "14:11 does it mean to sequence it? like aren't\n",
       "14:13 they already in the sequence?\n",
       "14:16 >> Yes, it's like we we call it sequence.\n",
       "14:19 Basically, what what you do is like you\n",
       "14:21 have like a sample. It it can be an\n",
       "14:23 environmental sample or you it can be\n",
       "14:25 like a blood kind of sample.\n",
       "14:28 >> Okay. So, for example, I um a few years\n",
       "14:30 ago, was it like four years ago, I did\n",
       "14:34 uh there is a website called My\n",
       "14:36 Heritage. It's ancestry.\n",
       "14:39 Exactly. So I wanted to know where my\n",
       "14:41 ancestors are coming from.\n",
       "14:43 >> Mhm.\n",
       "14:44 >> So what uh we did what they did they\n",
       "14:47 sent um like a small thing that I needed\n",
       "14:51 to put under my cheek and like um swap\n",
       "14:53 there\n",
       "14:54 >> under one and then the other side uh\n",
       "14:57 under the other cheek. Then I put it in\n",
       "14:59 the small tube and send it back. Right.\n",
       "15:01 So that was the sample. Right. So they\n",
       "15:03 took my saliva to analyze.\n",
       "15:05 >> Mhm. And then after a few weeks they\n",
       "15:07 said uh where my ancestors are coming\n",
       "15:10 from. So it turned out that I'm 70% uh\n",
       "15:14 um how do I say Baltics like from the\n",
       "15:18 the Baltic countries\n",
       "15:20 >> uh and then like I don't know 20% uh\n",
       "15:23 Western European and then like the rest\n",
       "15:25 is you know a mixture of everything.\n",
       "15:28 >> So that was cool. Uh but I guess that's\n",
       "15:30 uh one of the applications of\n",
       "15:31 bioinformatics right?\n",
       "15:33 >> Mhm. Yeah.\n",
       "15:35 >> Yeah. So, so what happened like can you\n",
       "15:37 walk us through? So, they took a sample\n",
       "15:39 and what happens after the sample once\n",
       "15:40 they receive it in the lab?\n",
       "15:42 >> Yes. Then you you have this\n",
       "15:46 these machines that can kind of analyze\n",
       "15:50 the data. this kind of they call it the\n",
       "15:52 sequencers where basically like um you\n",
       "15:56 kind of extract the DNA in in the sample\n",
       "16:00 and then you will kind of read it and\n",
       "16:04 then you will decode it. So you will see\n",
       "16:06 like what in what order of of kind of\n",
       "16:11 nucleotides kind of your sample is in\n",
       "16:14 and then like there are different steps.\n",
       "16:18 So so\n",
       "16:19 and there are there are different\n",
       "16:21 technologies to do this but in the end\n",
       "16:22 it's like you assemble everything. Yeah.\n",
       "16:25 you you you kind of kind of break kind\n",
       "16:28 of the the samples in in small pieces\n",
       "16:32 and then you assemble everything and\n",
       "16:34 then you kind of reconstruct the whole\n",
       "16:36 genome. So the whole kind of your whole\n",
       "16:40 DNA structure let's say and from that\n",
       "16:45 it's like you can like there are some\n",
       "16:47 databases where where uh you have\n",
       "16:49 information about okay this specific\n",
       "16:52 string of DNA corresponds to this gene\n",
       "16:55 that and this gene can codify to this\n",
       "16:58 specific protein that is involved in I\n",
       "17:02 don't know in a disease or or also the\n",
       "17:05 ancestry there are some biomarkers that\n",
       "17:07 you can track that okay this biomarker\n",
       "17:10 belongs to this kind of population here.\n",
       "17:13 So yeah this is usually the approach\n",
       "17:16 >> I think one I was 1% Irish or Welsh I\n",
       "17:20 don't remember.\n",
       "17:21 >> So I guess uh they saw like they take\n",
       "17:24 the sequence they break it into chunks\n",
       "17:25 and then one of the chunks corresponded\n",
       "17:28 to people living in Ireland right?\n",
       "17:30 >> Mhm. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
       "17:32 >> Okay.\n",
       "17:32 >> You can database\n",
       "17:34 >> I see. Um so this is a a model right so\n",
       "17:38 I don't know if it's machine learning\n",
       "17:39 but some sort of data analytics uh model\n",
       "17:42 right so you take a DNA you sequence you\n",
       "17:45 chunk and then you look at the chunks\n",
       "17:47 where\n",
       "17:49 they belong to right so which\n",
       "17:51 >> comparing to a reference genome\n",
       "17:53 >> okay interesting uh I assume you didn't\n",
       "17:56 do this you did something else right\n",
       "17:58 >> yes you did\n",
       "17:59 >> so what was the so now with when I\n",
       "18:02 understand a little more about\n",
       "18:03 biotechnology and bioinformatic Maybe\n",
       "18:06 you can tell it one more time what you\n",
       "18:09 were doing in that project was macra\n",
       "18:12 >> beyond.\n",
       "18:14 So yeah I don't even I can't even read\n",
       "18:16 my handwritings about that.\n",
       "18:20 >> Yes. Yes I can tell about that like yeah\n",
       "18:22 that was my master thesis project. So\n",
       "18:26 basically in in that case we took data\n",
       "18:31 from\n",
       "18:33 is what we call metagenomics which is\n",
       "18:35 when you take s environmental samples\n",
       "18:38 instead of let's say blood samples. So\n",
       "18:41 you take environmental samples\n",
       "18:43 >> samples are this like I don't know I go\n",
       "18:45 to a lake and I take uh\n",
       "18:48 >> a sample. Okay.\n",
       "18:49 >> Mhm. Yeah. you you go to any kind of\n",
       "18:51 environment you you you take um um I\n",
       "18:54 don't know from the ground like like a\n",
       "18:56 sample and then you can you can see like\n",
       "18:58 what microorganisms are living there. So\n",
       "19:01 it's basically you you decode the whole\n",
       "19:05 DNA that is there and then you kind of\n",
       "19:08 try to reconstruct like what genomes\n",
       "19:11 from what microorganisms are in this\n",
       "19:13 sample. So this is much more complex\n",
       "19:15 than the just a blood sample that is\n",
       "19:17 just one individual. In this case, you\n",
       "19:20 are trying to kind of reconstruct the\n",
       "19:22 the kind of genomes of the of all the\n",
       "19:25 micro that live there.\n",
       "19:27 >> So the goal of this step is so you take\n",
       "19:29 a sample then you take um you need to\n",
       "19:32 understand what kind of things are in\n",
       "19:36 the sample, right? So what kind of\n",
       "19:37 organisms microorganis?\n",
       "19:41 >> Mhm. Yes. Mhm. So yeah and in this case\n",
       "19:45 we focus on wastewater treatment plants.\n",
       "19:49 So we wanted to kind of analyze this\n",
       "19:52 data because in the database that we\n",
       "19:55 that we took it was kind of the most\n",
       "19:58 there were a lot of samples from there\n",
       "20:00 and it was kind of there were kind of\n",
       "20:03 samples from different places. So we\n",
       "20:05 wanted to integrate all of this data\n",
       "20:10 and so we basically download the and in\n",
       "20:13 the end the what what you have is a\n",
       "20:17 abundant an abundance table what we call\n",
       "20:20 so in the rows you have kind of the\n",
       "20:23 micronisms and in the columns you have\n",
       "20:26 the samples so you have and you you have\n",
       "20:28 counts so let's say that in sample one\n",
       "20:31 you have I don't know five counts from\n",
       "20:34 this micro organism. So this is the kind\n",
       "20:38 of end result of this metagenomics and\n",
       "20:40 this is the data that we have. So yeah,\n",
       "20:44 we download this kind of abundance\n",
       "20:46 tables from um different projects and\n",
       "20:49 different studies and we kind of try to\n",
       "20:52 kind of categorize them by different\n",
       "20:55 kind of biomes\n",
       "20:57 and then we infer these microbial\n",
       "21:00 association networks. So is basically\n",
       "21:04 based on correlations. So if you find\n",
       "21:06 kind of co-abundance patterns between\n",
       "21:10 different microorganisms, you can assume\n",
       "21:12 that these micronisms are interacting\n",
       "21:14 somehow.\n",
       "21:16 And\n",
       "21:16 >> what does it mean co-abundance patterns?\n",
       "21:18 So this when you have this sample right\n",
       "21:21 and you understand that you have like I\n",
       "21:23 don't know three samples of three counts\n",
       "21:26 from organism A five counts from\n",
       "21:30 organism B and then there is in some\n",
       "21:32 other sample you have kind of similar\n",
       "21:34 thing right and then you\n",
       "21:37 >> by analyzing all this um abundance\n",
       "21:40 tables as you call them right\n",
       "21:43 >> you can see that these coorganisms these\n",
       "21:45 organisms tend to coexist Right. So you\n",
       "21:49 you see them together often in the same\n",
       "21:52 >> environments, right?\n",
       "21:54 >> Mhm. Yeah.\n",
       "21:55 >> Okay. Okay.\n",
       "21:56 >> Yeah. That's basically it. And yeah, and\n",
       "22:00 we kind of kind of create these links\n",
       "22:02 between these microorganisms if they are\n",
       "22:05 co-abundant.\n",
       "22:08 >> Interesting. Uh so for me um I never\n",
       "22:11 worked with this kind of data but what I\n",
       "22:14 did is I did a bit of NLP and in NLP you\n",
       "22:19 have this co occurrence tables. So you\n",
       "22:22 uh when you have some context\n",
       "22:25 and uh you see that certain words appear\n",
       "22:27 together then you can say that they are\n",
       "22:30 co how do you call them\n",
       "22:34 >> occurring\n",
       "22:35 >> couring yeah so there is a special term\n",
       "22:37 for that I don't remember like New York\n",
       "22:39 right so New York is always like that if\n",
       "22:40 you see New York like it's very likely\n",
       "22:44 that they coer right or um\n",
       "22:48 not usually names of movies it's names\n",
       "22:50 of movies uh but also some expressions\n",
       "22:53 right so if you see one word and maybe\n",
       "22:57 another one is very likely to happen\n",
       "22:58 there or sometimes certain words just\n",
       "23:01 follow each other right so like after a\n",
       "23:04 verb uh make we have another I don't\n",
       "23:07 know noun make noise right so maybe this\n",
       "23:10 is how you use so this is what they do\n",
       "23:12 in NLP and then they use I don't\n",
       "23:16 remember it was so long ago but\n",
       "23:17 basically there's simple there are\n",
       "23:19 simple statistics you calculate um\n",
       "23:23 I remember it involved al lo al lo al lo\n",
       "23:25 al lo al lo al lo al lo al lo al lo al\n",
       "23:25 lo al lo al lo al lo al lo al lo al lo\n",
       "23:25 al lo al lo al lo al logarithms but\n",
       "23:26 basically you do a statistical test like\n",
       "23:28 how likely that these two things they're\n",
       "23:31 just so common that they\n",
       "23:34 um always you find them in sample or\n",
       "23:36 it's actually stat statistic you have\n",
       "23:38 statistically significant evidence that\n",
       "23:41 they co occur right so then you perform\n",
       "23:43 the statistical test and you can\n",
       "23:45 conclude that this is a like biogram or\n",
       "23:48 whatever right and the came with in the\n",
       "23:50 commander systems. and recommend\n",
       "23:51 systems. um I don't know um I buy um\n",
       "24:00 phone and then I need a charger right\n",
       "24:02 something like this I don't don't know\n",
       "24:04 right now they don't sell chargers with\n",
       "24:06 phones right but anyway so there there\n",
       "24:07 are certain types of things that you\n",
       "24:10 tend to buy together so then you can\n",
       "24:12 also find this coccurrence patterns in\n",
       "24:14 people's uh transactions right using a\n",
       "24:17 very similar approach and then based on\n",
       "24:19 that based on simple statistics you can\n",
       "24:20 recommend actually these products\n",
       "24:23 And what you do\n",
       "24:25 looks very similar.\n",
       "24:27 >> Mhm.\n",
       "24:27 >> Right. What do you use there?\n",
       "24:31 >> In that case is like we use um kind of\n",
       "24:35 um a method based on actually it's\n",
       "24:39 called CC lasso. So is based on yeah on\n",
       "24:41 on the lasso algorithm to kind of\n",
       "24:45 predict this yeah predict this kind of\n",
       "24:50 potential interactions among the\n",
       "24:51 micronisms. So we in the end we kind of\n",
       "24:54 calculate this um correlation values\n",
       "24:58 among every pair of micronisms.\n",
       "25:02 Uh\n",
       "25:03 >> so how does it work? Do you create like\n",
       "25:05 a regression model? Yeah. with this um\n",
       "25:10 interactions right between organis one\n",
       "25:13 and organis B right and a regression\n",
       "25:15 model and if the coefficient is not zero\n",
       "25:17 then it means that this these things co\n",
       "25:22 abundant right\n",
       "25:23 >> yeah it's like we we we kind of we\n",
       "25:26 obtain a value between minus one and one\n",
       "25:30 and then if there is kind of we kind of\n",
       "25:33 set a threshold um to kind of define\n",
       "25:39 if the value keeps on the table or not\n",
       "25:41 and then we can specify the table and\n",
       "25:44 then\n",
       "25:44 >> we kind of keep and then we have kind of\n",
       "25:47 negative and positive correlations\n",
       "25:50 >> we can\n",
       "25:51 >> which can have kind of some biological\n",
       "25:53 interpretation but you can be you should\n",
       "25:55 be careful with that.\n",
       "25:57 >> Mhm. What does the negative correlation\n",
       "25:59 mean in this case?\n",
       "26:01 >> Is that that that the the microorganisms\n",
       "26:04 kind of when one microorganism is in is\n",
       "26:07 in the sample the other is not there. So\n",
       "26:09 maybe they are kind of releasing some\n",
       "26:12 components that kind of kind of\n",
       "26:15 >> I don't know one cannot live in the same\n",
       "26:17 environment as the other.\n",
       "26:18 >> I see. I see. Okay. So\n",
       "26:21 >> yeah. Okay. Positive correlation means\n",
       "26:23 they like to coexist together. Negative\n",
       "26:26 correlation means that they don't exist\n",
       "26:28 together. Right.\n",
       "26:29 >> Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
       "26:31 >> But like could it be just geographic or\n",
       "26:32 when you do this co-abundance pattern\n",
       "26:35 extraction you restrict yourself to a\n",
       "26:38 certain area. Let's say you take a lake\n",
       "26:40 and then you just take all the samples\n",
       "26:42 around this lake and then the lake and\n",
       "26:43 then you do the analysis there. So these\n",
       "26:45 things that are potentially that\n",
       "26:46 potentially live together but in the\n",
       "26:48 samples you don't see them. Right.\n",
       "26:50 That's\n",
       "26:50 >> Yeah, it can be.\n",
       "26:52 >> Yeah.\n",
       "26:52 >> Okay. That's interesting.\n",
       "26:54 >> Mhm. So uh did you have experience in uh\n",
       "26:58 working with like non bioinformatics\n",
       "27:00 data\n",
       "27:02 >> in like like before in general or\n",
       "27:06 >> in general? Yeah.\n",
       "27:08 >> Uh actually most of the projects that\n",
       "27:11 I've been working on have been like in\n",
       "27:13 biology.\n",
       "27:16 Yeah. like different kind of types of\n",
       "27:19 data like at some point that work on\n",
       "27:22 more like kind of simulations of\n",
       "27:24 proteins\n",
       "27:26 and it's like in that case it's like you\n",
       "27:29 have some kind of proteins like a\n",
       "27:32 protein and a lian that you know that\n",
       "27:34 they interact and then you run kind of\n",
       "27:36 simulations like you you basically\n",
       "27:39 simulate a water box and then you kind\n",
       "27:42 of let the proteins move on simulation\n",
       "27:47 and then you have some kind of\n",
       "27:49 physicchemical kind of parameters and\n",
       "27:51 then you measure it and then you can see\n",
       "27:54 kind of if they interact or not\n",
       "27:56 something like that but I did that like\n",
       "27:58 when I was in my bachelors but yeah most\n",
       "28:00 of the things are kind of biology\n",
       "28:02 related\n",
       "28:03 >> yeah the reason I'm asking about that is\n",
       "28:06 cuz I was curious if you observed any\n",
       "28:08 similar patterns like right now you were\n",
       "28:10 talking about this co-abundance pattern\n",
       "28:11 and I thought okay like this is very\n",
       "28:13 similar to the thing I was doing before\n",
       "28:15 like even though it was a while ago but\n",
       "28:17 like\n",
       "28:18 >> and I thought wow like it's um\n",
       "28:21 >> now I understand a little bit about\n",
       "28:23 bionformmatics cuz like my experience my\n",
       "28:25 past experience from working on\n",
       "28:27 something completely unrelated can\n",
       "28:29 actually transfer to bioinformatics and\n",
       "28:31 for me was like wow so cool and I was\n",
       "28:34 thinking maybe like there are other\n",
       "28:36 things like that\n",
       "28:37 >> so that's why I asked you about your\n",
       "28:39 experience with working other things cuz\n",
       "28:41 uh I imagine maybe somebody's actually\n",
       "28:44 >> listening here who has this. Uh I see\n",
       "28:47 that there is a Mark who says um that\n",
       "28:51 he's a microbiology student and the meal\n",
       "28:53 engineer. Yeah. Hi Mark.\n",
       "28:55 >> Um\n",
       "28:57 anyways um so yeah I know we're kind of\n",
       "29:03 uh like there are questions that we\n",
       "29:04 prepared but I'm a bit sidelining\n",
       "29:08 uh because I'm really interested in\n",
       "29:09 these things like what you mentioned and\n",
       "29:11 I'm curious to know more. So you were\n",
       "29:15 talking about protein experiments\n",
       "29:18 and simulation of proteins\n",
       "29:21 >> and was it a few years ago when I think\n",
       "29:24 it was Google they managed to use AI for\n",
       "29:28 >> oh yeah\n",
       "29:29 >> proteins\n",
       "29:30 >> predict the kind of the structure from\n",
       "29:32 the sequence kind of alpha fault maybe\n",
       "29:34 >> alpha fault yeah and for me uh like\n",
       "29:37 everyone was talking about this that\n",
       "29:38 this is such a breakthrough\n",
       "29:40 >> and nobody were able to do this before.\n",
       "29:44 >> Mhm.\n",
       "29:44 >> And for me I because my background in uh\n",
       "29:47 this is very limited for me I did not\n",
       "29:50 understand the significance of this.\n",
       "29:52 >> Mhm.\n",
       "29:53 >> Right. And now I get a chance to talk to\n",
       "29:55 somebody who understand these things.\n",
       "29:58 >> So I wonder maybe you can explain in\n",
       "30:00 simple terms like what's the big deal of\n",
       "30:02 this alpha fault like why do we care\n",
       "30:05 >> about these things?\n",
       "30:06 >> Yes. basically like in general kind of\n",
       "30:09 proteins are really important because\n",
       "30:11 they kind of they do all the functions\n",
       "30:14 that living organisms\n",
       "30:17 kind of do. So they are\n",
       "30:20 so so for me I have like this mentality\n",
       "30:22 of how you say a gym bro like proteins\n",
       "30:24 are important because like after\n",
       "30:26 training you need to consume proteins.\n",
       "30:32 Right.\n",
       "30:34 >> Yes. But\n",
       "30:35 >> they are important on other levels too,\n",
       "30:37 right? Not just for that.\n",
       "30:39 >> Basically they they are like these small\n",
       "30:41 molecules that do all of the kind of\n",
       "30:44 jobs at small scales and big scales. So\n",
       "30:48 yeah and um there were effort a lot of\n",
       "30:52 kind of efforts to kind of\n",
       "30:55 because the thing is that the first you\n",
       "30:58 have the sequence the protein sequence\n",
       "31:00 but then when the proteins kind of do\n",
       "31:04 kind of the different jobs they kind of\n",
       "31:06 fold in a in the 3D space and\n",
       "31:13 the kind of\n",
       "31:14 >> sequence is a a string right with all\n",
       "31:16 these four nucleio how nucleotypes or\n",
       "31:20 >> yeah like in proteins you have kind of\n",
       "31:23 32 amino acids because it's not DNA\n",
       "31:25 anymore so it's kind of\n",
       "31:27 >> okay but you have a string right but\n",
       "31:29 this string is already like I don't know\n",
       "31:32 can you call it sequence or like we have\n",
       "31:33 a string but when you put the string\n",
       "31:36 into the real space in 3D they start\n",
       "31:40 like uh folding\n",
       "31:42 >> exactly\n",
       "31:43 >> and the way they fold it could be the\n",
       "31:46 same thing but uh if they fall\n",
       "31:48 differently then they would serve\n",
       "31:49 different functions right\n",
       "31:51 >> mhm exactly\n",
       "31:52 >> okay okay\n",
       "31:54 >> yes and then it's like the the kind of\n",
       "31:56 the search space there is huge I\n",
       "31:59 remember that it was kind of more than\n",
       "32:01 the the stars in the universe or\n",
       "32:04 something like that so this kind of\n",
       "32:06 transition from the sequence to the\n",
       "32:08 structure is is really difficult to\n",
       "32:10 predict and to kind of yeah the to see\n",
       "32:15 And there were a lot of efforts like\n",
       "32:17 from other like more traditional kind of\n",
       "32:20 approaches to do this. And uh kind of\n",
       "32:24 the the yeah there there was this\n",
       "32:27 competition that is called CASP that\n",
       "32:29 kind of evaluates this kind of they do\n",
       "32:32 some task to some teams to kind of do\n",
       "32:34 these predictions and yeah when Alpha\n",
       "32:38 fall enter like Alpha Fall one they kind\n",
       "32:41 of just did the predictions much better\n",
       "32:46 better than the other teams and\n",
       "32:50 and these kind of applications can kind\n",
       "32:53 Like by knowing the structure of the\n",
       "32:55 proteins from the sequence\n",
       "32:58 you can because usually like to do this\n",
       "33:01 uh to kind of the kind of know the\n",
       "33:04 structure of the protein you do this in\n",
       "33:06 in the wet lab and then you use this um\n",
       "33:10 kind of crystalallography and X-ray\n",
       "33:13 experiments and it's really really\n",
       "33:15 difficult. I remember that I had a\n",
       "33:17 friend that did this kind a PhD in this\n",
       "33:20 field and the kind of knowing the\n",
       "33:23 structure of one single protein was the\n",
       "33:26 whole PhD project of of her. So it it's\n",
       "33:30 really time consuming and kind of it can\n",
       "33:32 take a lot of time and when Alphaold\n",
       "33:35 kind of did this you can do it like in\n",
       "33:38 seconds it's Yeah. It's it's crazy\n",
       "33:42 >> instead of five years.\n",
       "33:43 >> Exactly.\n",
       "33:44 >> It is. Yeah, it's like\n",
       "33:48 it depends on what type of protein like\n",
       "33:50 in kind of single proteins with kind of\n",
       "33:54 that are not in complexes or kind of\n",
       "33:56 that yeah I don't remember like the\n",
       "33:59 specificities but in certain cases like\n",
       "34:01 like basically the basic ones it does a\n",
       "34:04 good job like kind of I think that 90%\n",
       "34:10 kind of confidence but when you have\n",
       "34:12 more complicated structures it is not\n",
       "34:15 that And you need kind of to validate\n",
       "34:17 that with the experimental\n",
       "34:19 >> one. What are the practical\n",
       "34:21 implications? Can we do drug discovery\n",
       "34:24 faster now or?\n",
       "34:25 >> Yes. Yes. Yes, we can do uh drug\n",
       "34:27 discovery and also kind of explore like\n",
       "34:33 more kind of proteins applications in\n",
       "34:36 different fields like agriculture and\n",
       "34:39 kind of yeah other areas because you can\n",
       "34:43 apply also these enzymes for instance in\n",
       "34:45 industry like you can create an an\n",
       "34:48 enzyme that do a specific process that\n",
       "34:50 accelerated\n",
       "34:51 >> like different things. So yeah\n",
       "34:54 applications are kind of everywhere\n",
       "34:56 >> and these proteins are important because\n",
       "34:58 they are building blocks for many\n",
       "35:00 organisms right.\n",
       "35:01 >> Yes.\n",
       "35:02 >> This is the reason like I was talking\n",
       "35:03 about this example like you go to gym\n",
       "35:05 and then you need to consume certain\n",
       "35:06 amount of proteins. This is important\n",
       "35:08 because you want to build your muscles\n",
       "35:10 and this is the building blocks, right?\n",
       "35:13 So these proteins that uh people consume\n",
       "35:16 that I consume they can they go to\n",
       "35:19 certain parts of your body and then they\n",
       "35:21 uh I don't know the body kind of\n",
       "35:23 deconstructs them and then they can fold\n",
       "35:24 in certain structures or what exactly is\n",
       "35:27 happening?\n",
       "35:28 >> Yes, it's like the there are the thing\n",
       "35:31 is that there are also different types\n",
       "35:32 of proteins. There are one of these that\n",
       "35:34 kind of assemble together to create the\n",
       "35:36 kind of more complicated structures but\n",
       "35:38 also there are the ones that kind of do\n",
       "35:41 other functions like the hemoglobin for\n",
       "35:43 instance they kind of carry oxygen like\n",
       "35:47 in the body and yeah in\n",
       "35:51 >> every function that the living organisms\n",
       "35:53 does like there is a protein involved.\n",
       "35:55 So that's why they are really important.\n",
       "35:58 >> Mhm. And we living we the living\n",
       "36:00 organisms we consume these proteins and\n",
       "36:03 the body uses the parts of the protein\n",
       "36:06 for its purposes right.\n",
       "36:07 >> Mhm.\n",
       "36:08 >> I see. Interesting. Um yeah I mean I\n",
       "36:13 cannot\n",
       "36:14 say with confidence I understood\n",
       "36:16 everything but at least it's a little\n",
       "36:17 bit more clearer right now. Thank you.\n",
       "36:20 >> You worked on quite a few projects. Look\n",
       "36:22 at the document like the projects um\n",
       "36:26 Mike V2 graph view gen view core um\n",
       "36:32 >> what are these projects and uh can you\n",
       "36:34 tell us more about these projects what\n",
       "36:35 do they do?\n",
       "36:36 >> Yes I already mentioned this MCW2 graph\n",
       "36:40 who was the kind of knowledge graph with\n",
       "36:43 the microorganisms and\n",
       "36:45 >> yeah last year I was\n",
       "36:47 >> we talked about this core abundance\n",
       "36:49 patterns right?\n",
       "36:50 >> Yes. So once you extract the patterns\n",
       "36:52 you can put them in a graph right. So\n",
       "36:54 these these nodes have positive\n",
       "36:56 coefficients. These nodes have negative\n",
       "36:58 coefficients. Right. And then not nodes\n",
       "37:00 but vertices sorry the edges.\n",
       "37:03 >> Uh right. Okay. So graph.\n",
       "37:06 >> Mhm. And then every node is a\n",
       "37:08 microorganisms and you have an edge if\n",
       "37:10 there is like a cobundance patterns\n",
       "37:13 among them. And then what we did is that\n",
       "37:15 we created these kind of graphs and then\n",
       "37:18 we enrich that with some metadata. let's\n",
       "37:20 say some that we know that a mic\n",
       "37:22 organisms release a specific metabolite\n",
       "37:25 or that a microorganisms is living in a\n",
       "37:27 specific biome. So we kind of added that\n",
       "37:31 information and we build this knowledge\n",
       "37:33 graph.\n",
       "37:34 Yeah. And then we applied some\n",

       "38:26 Um that's very interesting. Um so how\n",
       "38:29 can people use it now?\n",
