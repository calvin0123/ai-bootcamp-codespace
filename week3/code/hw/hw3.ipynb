While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.<ref name=\"Alho 1987\"/> Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/><ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> when the animals gather around available water sources.

Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent farther by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]]. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1984\"/>\\n\\n===Reproduction===\\n[[File:Young capybaras.jpg|thumb|left|Mother with typical litter of about four pups]]\\nWhen in [[estrus]], the female\\'s scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.<ref name=\"Herrera 1993\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/4.2.114|title= Aggression, dominance, and mating success among capybara males (\\'\\'Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris\\'\\')|year=1993|last1=Herrera|first1=Emilio A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=David W.|journal=[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]]|volume=4|issue=2|page=114}}</ref> In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice.

While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.<ref name=\"Alho 1987\"/> Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/><ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> when the animals gather around available water sources.

Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent farther by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]]. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1984\"/>\\n\\n===Reproduction===\\n[[File:Young capybaras.jpg|thumb|left|Mother with typical litter of about four pups]]\\nWhen in [[estrus]], the female\\'s scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.<ref name=\"Herrera 1993\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/4.2.114|title= Aggression, dominance, and mating success among capybara males (\\'\\'Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris\\'\\')|year=1993|last1=Herrera|first1=Emilio A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=David W.|journal=[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]]|volume=4|issue=2|page=114}}</ref> In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice.

While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.<ref name=\"Alho 1987\"/> Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/><ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> when the animals gather around available water sources.

Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent farther by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]].

The [[dentition|dental formula]] is similar to that of various other rodents: {{DentalFormula|upper=1.0.1.3|lower=1.0.1.3}}. Females give birth to two or three furred and active young after a [[gestation]] period of 50 to 90 days in most species, or 150 days in the capybara. In most species, they are sexually mature within a few months of birth, although in capybaras, maturity is not reached until around 18 months.<ref name=EoM/>\\n\\nSocial organisation varies widely among the group. Many cavies are promiscuous, forming no long-lasting social groups, although, in some species, males maintain harems of two or more females. In contrast, maras are [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]], and form temporary colonial [[Crèche (zoology)|crèches]] to care for the young of multiple mothers. Capybaras live in groups of around 10 individuals, and sometimes many more, each with a single dominant male, and a number of females, subordinate males, and juveniles.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D. |author1=Herrera, E. |author2=Lacher, T.E. |author3=Macdonald, D. |author4=Taber, A.B. |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/690 690–699] |isbn=0-87196-871-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/690 }}</ref>\\n\\n==Classification==\\n{{further|List of caviids}}\\n\\nThe family Caviidae is a sister group to the family [[Dasyproctidae]], both of which are members of the superfamily Cavioidea.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://kit.eimb.ru/PDF/Veniaminova_07_G_en.pdf|title = Phylogeny of the order Rodentia inferred from structural analysis of short retroposon B1|last = Veniaminova|first = N.

The [[dentition|dental formula]] is similar to that of various other rodents: {{DentalFormula|upper=1.0.1.3|lower=1.0.1.3}}. Females give birth to two or three furred and active young after a [[gestation]] period of 50 to 90 days in most species, or 150 days in the capybara. In most species, they are sexually mature within a few months of birth, although in capybaras, maturity is not reached until around 18 months.<ref name=EoM/>\\n\\nSocial organisation varies widely among the group. Many cavies are promiscuous, forming no long-lasting social groups, although, in some species, males maintain harems of two or more females.

Physically, capybaras possess slightly webbed feet, enabling them to swim effectively. Their blunt muzzles and nostrils positioned at the top of their heads facilitate swimming and foraging in aquatic environments.

In some regions, they are farmed, which has positively impacted the conservation of their wetland habitats, ensuring their survival as these habitats are protected. Additionally, capybaras have adapted well to urbanization and can be found in zoos and parks, often living for up to 12 years in captivity. They are typically docile and often allow for human interaction, such as petting and hand-feeding, although direct physical contact is usually discouraged due to health concerns such as tick-borne diseases.\n",
