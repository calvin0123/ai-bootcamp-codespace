While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.<ref name=\"Alho 1987\"/> Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/><ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> They can make dog-like barks<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> when threatened or when females are herding young.<ref name=\"Murphey 1985\"/>\\n\\nCapybaras have two types of [[scent gland]]s: a morrillo, located on the snout, and [[anal gland]]s. Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent farther by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]]. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1984\"/>\\n\\n===Reproduction===\\n[[File:Young capybaras.jpg|thumb|left|Mother with typical litter of about four pups]]\\nWhen in [[estrus]], the female\\'s scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.<ref name=\"Herrera 1993\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/4.2.114|title= Aggression, dominance, and mating success among capybara males (\\'\\'Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris\\'\\')|year=1993|last1=Herrera|first1=Emilio A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=David W.|journal=[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]]|volume=4|issue=2|page=114}}</ref> In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice.

The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females.

Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group.<ref name=\"Bristol\"/> [[Alloparenting]] has been observed in this species.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in [[Mato Grosso]], Brazil.<ref name=r4/>\\n\\n===Activities===\\nThough quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water.

While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.<ref name=\"Alho 1987\"/> Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/><ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> They can make dog-like barks<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> when threatened or when females are herding young.<ref name=\"Murphey 1985\"/>\\n\\nCapybaras have two types of [[scent gland]]s: a morrillo, located on the snout, and [[anal gland]]s. Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent farther by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]]. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1984\"/>\\n\\n===Reproduction===\\n[[File:Young capybaras.jpg|thumb|left|Mother with typical litter of about four pups]]\\nWhen in [[estrus]], the female\\'s scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.<ref name=\"Herrera 1993\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/4.2.114|title= Aggression, dominance, and mating success among capybara males (\\'\\'Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris\\'\\')|year=1993|last1=Herrera|first1=Emilio A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=David W.|journal=[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]]|volume=4|issue=2|page=114}}</ref> In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice.

The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females.

The young form a group within the main group.<ref name=\"Bristol\"/> [[Alloparenting]] has been observed in this species.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in [[Mato Grosso]], Brazil.<ref name=r4/>\\n\\n===Activities===\\nThough quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water.

While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.<ref name=\"Alho 1987\"/> Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/><ref name=\"Macdonald 1981\"/> when the animals gather around available water sources.

Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent farther by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]].

The [[dentition|dental formula]] is similar to that of various other rodents: {{DentalFormula|upper=1.0.1.3|lower=1.0.1.3}}. Females give birth to two or three furred and active young after a [[gestation]] period of 50 to 90 days in most species, or 150 days in the capybara. In most species, they are sexually mature within a few months of birth, although in capybaras, maturity is not reached until around 18 months.<ref name=EoM/>\\n\\nSocial organisation varies widely among the group. Many cavies are promiscuous, forming no long-lasting social groups, although, in some species, males maintain harems of two or more females.

Physically, these semiaquatic mammals possess webbed feet, which assist in swimming, and they can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes, allowing them to evade predators. Capybaras also have a heavy, barrel-shaped body that contributes to their buoyancy in water, and their nostrils are positioned at the top of their head, allowing them to breathe while mostly submerged.\n",

      "Behaviorally, capybaras live in social groups, often ranging from about 10 to 20 individuals, and can gather in larger groups during the dry seasons when water sources become scarce. This social structure helps them maintain safety in numbers against predators. Communication is also crucial; capybaras use a variety of vocalizations—including barks, chirps, whistles, huffs, and purrs—to interact with one another, which helps strengthen social bonds within their groups. Additionally, they need to wallow and stay in water during hot weather, making their proximity to water essential for thermoregulation and skin hydration.\n",

They have a social structure that includes a dominant male, several females, subordinate males, and juveniles. **Reproduction** occurs within this social context, with females giving birth to litters that can range from one to eight offspring, although four is common. The gestation period is approximately 130 to 150 days, with females usually giving birth on land.\n",
      "\n",
      "After giving birth, the mother typically rejoins her group shortly after delivery. Young capybaras are precocial, meaning they are relatively mature and mobile shortly after birth and can start grazing as early as one week. They continue to suckle for up to 16 weeks and demonstrate **alloparenting**, wherein the young can suckle from any female in the group, enhancing their chances of survival. This communal care is vital for the successful upbringing of the young, allowing them to learn important survival skills from both their mothers and other adult females in the group. The supportive environment of social structures in capybaras significantly contributes to the development and survival of their young, making use of both maternal and communal care.\n",
